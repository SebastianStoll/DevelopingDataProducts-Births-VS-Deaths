The demographic development within a country or region is fundamental for decision making. For example an aging and declining population requires different strategies than a population which is getting younger.

This app shows the development of births and deaths measured per 1000 population for different countries and regions. 

Select the country or region dropdown to update the respective graph. Change the year range selection to only show a period of interest. 

By default the y limit is set to zero which makes it easier to get a feel for the range of values. If not selected the min and max of both death and birth time series are used to define the y limits for the graph.

The data for this app is taken from The World Bank. Please refer to the following links for more information about the deaths and births data sets:
